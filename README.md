# CS350-Thermostat

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to create a working thermostat that could detect the ambient air temperature, 
create a set point where the heat will turn on if the temperature falls below that point, and display output 
to the user as well as provide functionality to change the set point. This was achieved by implementing drivers 
to use the resources on the board such as serially communicating with another device, reading input from the 
sensors and buttons on the board, and manipulating the GPIO to turn on/off LEDs on the board.

## What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did well was read the header files of the provided TI drivers to support the functionality of the 
board. This helped me with problem solving, sharpened my skills with understanding the C programming language, 
and helped me gain a better understanding of how the software interacts and controls the hardware.

## Where could you improve?
One place I would like to improve my skills is working with state machines. State machines are ways to 
accurately control the hardware on the board without overcomplicating the code. I feel that I have a good 
understating of how they work and how to implement them, but I need to practice more with designing them to 
flawlessly incorporate them into my designs.
